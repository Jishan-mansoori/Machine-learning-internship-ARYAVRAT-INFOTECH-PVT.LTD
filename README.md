#  Customer Churn Prediction – ML Internship Project

Welcome! This repository documents my 6-week Machine Learning Internship focused on predicting customer churn in a telecom dataset. The goal is to build an end-to-end ML pipeline — from data analysis to deployment — as part of my academic learning and hands-on experience.
